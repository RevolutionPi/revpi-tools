.SH NAME
revpi-factory-reset \- reset device tree overlay,
password, machine-id, hostname, FQDN and MAC address
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B revpi-factory-reset \fI<compact|connect|core>\fP \fI<serial>\fP \fI<mac address>\fP
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B revpi-factory-reset
resets the product-specific device tree overlay,
.br
- the password of user \fIpi\fP,
.br
- the machine-id (128-bit hex string in \fI/etc/machine-id\fP),
.br
- the hostname (e.g. \fIRevPi256\fP),
.br
- the FQDN (e.g.
.I abcde12345.co.revolutionpi.de\fP) and
.br
- the MAC address of each network interface (e.g.
.I c8:3e:a7:00:00:00\fP) to factory defaults.

The password, machine-id and FQDN are automatically
computed from the serial number stored in the RevPi's Atmel
CryptoAuth chip.

The serial number used for the hostname and the
MAC address are lasered on the RevPi's front plate and need to
be supplied as arguments to \fBrevpi-factory-reset\fP.  The MAC address
is allowed to contain numbers, upper or lower case characters and dashes
or colons as byte separators.   On RevPis with more than one network
interface, only a single MAC address needs to be specified.  The other
MAC addresses are computed automatically since they are consecutive.

Revolution Pi is a set of IoT products based on the Raspberry Pi and
geared towards industrial usage.
