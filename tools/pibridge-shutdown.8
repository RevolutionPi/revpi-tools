.SH NAME
pibridge-shutdown \- shut down a PiBridge Ethernet interface if no gateway is attached
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B pibridge-shutdown <interface>
.SH DESCRIPTION
On the RevPi Core, the interrupt pin of the two PiBridge Ethernet interfaces
is not connected.  The interrupt must therefore be polled, which occupies
about 10% of one CPU core of a Compute Module 3. That's a waste of resources
if no gateway is attached. \fBpibridge-shutdown\fP therefore checks the carrier
state upon system boot and shuts the interface down if no carrier is detected.
It also tells dhcpcd to no longer manage the interface.

The issue is not present on the RevPi Connect, so PiBridge interfaces need
not be shut down on this product. \fBpibridge-shutdown\fP identifies affected
products by checking whether a valid interrupt is defined in the DeviceTree.

.B pibridge-shutdown
is invoked by the systemd units pileft-quirks.service and
piright-quirks.service, which in turn are "wanted by" the systemd units
pileft.device and piright.device via appropriate udev rules in
/lib/udev/rules.d/50-revpi.rules.
