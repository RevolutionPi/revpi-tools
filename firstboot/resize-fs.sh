# The eMMC has 3.9 GByte on RevPis equipped with a CM1 or CM3, but those
# equipped with a CM3+ may have 7.8, 15.6 or 31.2 GByte.  Original RevPi images
# fit the 3.9 GByte eMMC.  If the eMMC is larger, "resize-fs.sh"
# resizes the last partition to the maximum available on the eMMC. Normally
# the last partition is the root partition but users are free to create
# custom images for the CM3+ with an additional data partition at the end.
# The filesystem on the last partition is expected to be ext4 and will be
# resized as well.
