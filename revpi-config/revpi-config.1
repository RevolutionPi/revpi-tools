.SH NAME
revpi-config \- enable and disable features on a RevPi
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B revpi-config enable | disable | status | available | availstat <feature>
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B revpi-config
allows enabling and disabling specific settings in /boot/config.txt as well as
systemd services on a RevPi.  It also allows querying the status (whether
enabled) and availability (whether installed) of each feature and will convey
the result on standard output (1 or 0).

The availability and status of a feature can also be queried simultaneously
using the
.B availstat
command. The return value is 2 if the feature is not available, 1 if the feature
is available and enabled and 0 if the feature is available but not enabled.

Revolution Pi is a set of IoT products based on the Raspberry Pi and geared
towards industrial usage.
.SH SUPPORTED FEATURES
.TP
.B gui
Boot to the graphical desktop versus the text console.  (Default is the
text console.)
.TP
.B downclock-cpu <frequency>
Downclock the ARM CPU to the specified value to achieve more predictable
latencies.  The ARM CPU will downclock further, if the core temperature
exceeds 80 degrees Celsius.  The frequency should therefore be chosen to
always keep the ARM CPU below this temperature under the expected load.
Only available on a RevPi with CM3.  (Default is dynamic frequency scaling
depending on the core temperature:  1200 MHz if the temperature is below
80 degrees; between 600 and 1200 MHz if the temperature exceeds 80 degrees
but is still below 85 degrees; between 300 and 600 MHz if the temperature
exceeds 85 degrees.)
.TP
.B perf-governor
Keep the CPU at the maximum allowed frequency even if it's idling.
This is achieved by switching to the "performance" cpufreq governor.
It avoids frequency changes which would otherwise introduce jitter
and generally improves responsiveness.  It is thus the recommended
setting for realtime environments.  Only available on a RevPi with CM3.
.TP
.B revpi-con-can
Enable CON CAN device tree overlay for the RevPi Connect.
(Default is disabled.)
.TP
.B var-log.mount
Store logs on a tmpfs-backed directory to reduce eMMC wear and free up
disk space.  Requires a reboot!  Logs will always be empty after a reboot,
so the ability to debug crashes is lost.  The total size of the directory
is capped at 50 MByte.  It is recommended to disable swap as well because
tmpfs is swappable.  (Default is to not use a tmpfs but store logs directly
on the eMMC.)
.TP
.B dphys-swapfile
Use swap.  Disabling it reduces eMMC wear and frees up disk space.
(Default is disabled.)
.TP
.B teamviewer-revpi
Start TeamViewer remote access service.  (Default is disabled.)
.TP
.B pimodbus-master
Start Revolution Pi Modbus master.  (Default is disabled.)
.TP
.B pimodbus-slave
Start Revolution Pi Modbus slave.  (Default is disabled.)
.TP
.B systemd-timesyncd
Start NTP daemon.  If there is no Internet connectivity, no GPS/DCF77
receiver and no NTP server on the LAN, it is recommendable to disable it.
This avoids continuous polling of the *.debian.pool.ntp.org servers and
error messages caused by their unreachability.  (Default is enabled.)
.TP
.B ssh
Start SSH daemon.  By disabling it, remote login is prevented and the
attack surface thus reduced.  (Default is enabled.)
.TP
.B logi-rts
Start logi.RTS PLC runtime system.  (Default is disabled.)
.TP
.B nodered
Start Node-RED runtime system.  (Default is disabled.)
.TP
.B noderedrevpinodes-server
Start daemon to bridge between Node-RED and piControl.  (Default is disabled.)
.TP
.B revpipyload
Start daemon to load and monitor a RevPiModIO application, serve the
piControl process image to RevPiNetIO, serve a configuration GUI and
publish IO values via MQTT.  (Default is disabled.)
.TP
.B avahi
Avahi is a system which facilitates service discovery on a local network via
the mDNS/DNS-SD protocol. This enables you to plug your computer into a
network and instantly be able to view other Revolution Pi's (this is also
branded as "Bonjour" and sometimes "Zeroconf").
.TP
.B bluetooth
Enable built-in Bluetooth interface using rfkill(8).  (Default is enabled.)
.TP
.B ieee80211
Enable built-in WLAN interface using rfkill(8).  (Default is enabled.)
.TP
.B external-antenna
Controls the use of the external antenna on a Revolution Pi with CM4 module.
After activating this option, the external antenna is used. When this option
is deactivated, the CM4 module falls back to the internal antenna by default.
