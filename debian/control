Description: Revolution Pi tools
 Assorted tools and support files for Revolution Pi products:
 .
  * udev rules to create symlinks for GPIO chips on the RevPi Compact,
    to create symlinks for serial ports on the RevPi Compact and Connect
    and to rename Ethernet ports on the RevPi Compact, Connect and Core
  * systemd services to check the carrier state of both PiBridge Ethernet
    ports on the RevPi Core and shut them down if no carrier is detected,
    thereby saving CPU time to poll the interrupt
  * scripts to enable/disable the relay watchdog on the RevPi Connect
  * sosreport plugin to collect Revolution Pi related system information
    which can be submitted to Kunbus as part of a support request
  * revpi-factory-reset is used to finalize a RevPi after the factory end
    of line test
 .
 Revolution Pi is a set of IoT products based on the Raspberry Pi and
